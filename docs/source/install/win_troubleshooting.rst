Common problems/troubleshooting

.. _wintrb:

**Prebuilt installer:**

*   Because the RAW team is an ‘unknown’ developer, you will probably see some
    security warnings when you install RAW. When you do, just give the installer
    and program permission to run on your computer.

*   RAW is used by (relatively) few people, which means some antivirus programs
    may not have seen the RAW software before. Occasionally virus scanners will mark
    a file (typically :file:`RAW.exe`) as a threat (it will usually be in the ‘general
    malware’ category). If this happens, please do the following:

    *   Upload the file to
        `https://www.virustotal.com/ <https://www.virustotal.com/>`_
        and see if any other antivirus programs identify it as a problem (it is
        always possible someone hijacked the installer somehow!).

    *   If most or all of the antivirus programs on virustotal.com clear the file, make an
        exception for it in your virus scanner.

    *   Contact the RAW developers, so we can report the false identification to the
        virus scanner company and get the file whitelisted in future definitions files.


**From source:**

*   If you are updating your RAW installation, you should completely delete the old RAW
    source files, and then replace them with the new ones.
