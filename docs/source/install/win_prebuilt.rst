Using a prebuilt installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. _winprebuilt:

The recommend way to install RAW on Windows is using a prebuilt installer. To install
from a prebuilt installer, simply download the **RAW-X.Y.Z-win32.msi** (where X.Y.Z is the
version number) file from sourceforge (
`http://sourceforge.net/projects/bioxtasraw <http://sourceforge.net/projects/bioxtasraw>`_),
and double click it to run the installer. You may need to navigate to the ‘Files’
tab on the sourceforge project website to find the latest **.msi** installer.

**Important Notes:**

*   Because the RAW team is an ‘unknown’ developer, you will probably see some security
    warnings when you install RAW. When you do, just give the installer and program
    permission to run on your computer.

*   RAW is used by (relatively) few people, which means many virus scanners have not seen
    the RAW software before. Occasionally virus scanners will mark a file (typically RAW.exe)
    as a threat (it will usually be in the ‘general malware’ category). If this happens,
    please do the following:

    *   Upload the file to `https://www.virustotal.com/ <https://www.virustotal.com/>`_
        and see if any other virus scanners identify it as a virus (it is always possible
        someone hijacked the installer somehow!).

    *   If most or all of the virus scanners on virustotal.com clear the file, make an
        exception for it in your virus scanner.

    *   Contact the RAW developers, so we can report the false identification to the
        virus scanner company and get the file whitelisted in future definitions files.
