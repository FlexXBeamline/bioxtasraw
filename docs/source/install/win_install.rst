RAW Install Guide for Microsoft Windows
----------------------------------------

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two ways to install RAW on Windows. The easiest, and recommended, way is to
use a prebuilt installer (**.msi** file). If you want to install a version for which
there is no prebuilt installer, you will need to install RAW from the source code.

This guide contains instructions for:

*   Using a prebuilt installer **(recommended):**

    *   :ref:`Windows 7, 8.1, and 10 <winprebuilt>`

*   :ref:`General instructions to install from source for advanced users <wingen>`

*   Detailed instructions to install from source for:

    *   :ref:`Windows 7 8.1, and 10 <winsource>`

It also provides :ref:`solutions to common problems <wintrb>` with the installation
from source.

Some of the downloads needed to install RAW from source are available in the
**RAW-Windows-Source-Install-Essentials** file on
`sourceforge <https://sourceforge.net/projects/bioxtasraw/files/>`_. Others you will have
to download yourself, due to licensing restrictions.

Conventions: things to type are in *italics*, file paths and file names are in
**bold**. OS version specific instructions are started in red.
