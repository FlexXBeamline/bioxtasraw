Using a prebuilt app package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. _macprebuilt:

The recommended way to install RAW on Mac is using a prebuilt app package. To install
from a prebuilt app package simply download the **RAW-X.Y.Z-mac.dmg** (where X.Y.Z is the
version number) file from sourceforge (
`http://sourceforge.net/projects/bioxtasraw <http://sourceforge.net/projects/bioxtasraw>`_),
double click it to open the dmg, and drag the **RAW.app** file to your Applications folder
(or wherever you want to install RAW).


**Important Notes:**

*   Because the RAW team is an unidentified developer, you may get a warning message
    the first time you run the program. If that happens, right click on RAW and
    select “Open” from the right click menu, and then click the “Open” button in the
    window that appears.

    *   *Note:* This requires administrator permissions.
