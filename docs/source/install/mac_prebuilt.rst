Using a prebuilt app package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. _macprebuilt:

The recommended way to install RAW on Mac is using a prebuilt app package. To install
from a prebuilt app package simply download the :file:`RAW-{x}.{y}.{z}-mac.dmg` (where :file:`{x}.{y}.{z}` is the
version number) file from sourceforge (
`http://sourceforge.net/projects/bioxtasraw <http://sourceforge.net/projects/bioxtasraw>`_),
double click it to open the dmg, and drag the :file:`RAW.app` file to your Applications folder
(or wherever you want to install RAW).


**Important Notes:**

*   Because the RAW team is an unidentified developer, you may get a warning message
    the first time you run the program. If that happens, right click on RAW and
    select :menuselection:`Open` from the right click menu, and then click the :guilabel:`Open` button in the
    window that appears.

    *   *Note:* This requires administrator permissions.
