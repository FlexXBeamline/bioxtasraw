**Installing the prebuilt app package:**

*   Because the RAW team is an unidentified developer, you may get a warning message the
    first time you run the program. If that happens, right click on RAW and select :menuselection:`Open`
    from the right click menu, and then click the :guilabel:`Open` button in the window that appears.

    *   This requires administrator privileges

*   If the above doesn’t work, you can run the RAW app from the command line. Navigate to
    :file:`RAW.app/Contents/MacOS` and run the RAW unix executable file (:file:`./RAW`) in that directory.


**Installing from source:**

*   The shortcut can fail if you didn’t install raw in the recommended location. If that’s
    the case, go through the process of creating a new shortcut, and make sure you change
    the line in the script mentioned in that section.
