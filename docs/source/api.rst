RAW API
============

.. _api:

The RAW API allows you to install BioXTAS RAW as a python package without the
GUI. This lets you import RAW directly into your python scripts and use the
API to call any of the functions in RAW. This is great for creating custom
processing scripts, either for unusual datasets that aren't handled in the
GUI, or to ensure reproducibility in your analysis. It can also be used as
the basis for an open-source automated SAXS data processing pipeline at a
beamline or homesource.
