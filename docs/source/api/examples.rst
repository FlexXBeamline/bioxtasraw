Examples
-------------------

Here are some simple examples of how to use the RAW API:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2
    :includehidden:

    ex_analyze_profile
    ex_batch_profile
    ex_sec_saxs

As the API gets more use, we hope there will be some open source projects
that you can check out that use the API in some way. If you have such a
project you'd like linked here, :ref:`please let us know <contactus>`.
