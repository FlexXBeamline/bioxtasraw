Line properties dialog
======================

.. _lineproperties:

The Manipulation, IFT, and SEC data items can all open a line properties dialog.
This dialog will let you control the following properties for each line associated
with the object:

Line: Style (solid, dashed, dotted), width, color

Error bars: Style (solid, dashed, dotted), width, color

Data point marker: Shape (the marker shapes are those used by matplotlib, which are defined here:
`http://matplotlib.org/api/markers_api.html <http://matplotlib.org/api/markers_api.html>`_),
size, edge line color, fill color, and whether or not the markers are hollow.

The line properties dialog also lets you set the legend label for the object, if any is needed.

If the dialog is exited with “OK”, all changes take effect. If the dialog is exited with “Cancel”,
the old settings are restored.
