Workspaces
==========

.. _workspaces:

RAW allows you to save and load sets of files that you are analyzing, called
“workspaces”. To save a workspace, go the File menu and select “Save Workspace”.
To load a workspace, go to the File menu and select “Load Workspace”.

When you save a workspace, all of the items in the Manipulation, IFT, and SEC
panel are saved. When you load a workspace, all of those saved items are loaded
back up, with all of the analysis information and line settings they had previously.
Any files already open in RAW remain open when a workspace is loaded.

**Note:** The settings are not saved when a workspace is saved.
